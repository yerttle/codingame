An international Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock tournament is organized, all players receive a number when they register.

Each player chooses a sign that he will keep throughout the tournament among:
Rock (R)

Spock (S)

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
